You can't assume that the light will be at a certain position at a given absolute time - will be slowed down. What is everything doing at each one time, what is the modulator doing at this one time, (know differntial changes?) position of the light. When you go to single photons how to do you translate on phase? Nonlinearities, forward mixing sources, temporal dependence regime around them. \n",
